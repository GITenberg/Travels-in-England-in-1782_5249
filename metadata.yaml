description: "Reisen eines Deutschen in England im Jahre 1782 (English: Journeys of\
  \ a German in England in 1782) is a travel memoir by German author Karl Philipp\
  \ Moritz. Moritz was a young scholar and Anglophile traveling to England for the\
  \ first time. His journey was approximately two months during June and July 1782\
  \ and began in London where he saw famous sights, attended the theater and watched\
  \ sessions of Parliament. He then set out on foot for Richmond, stopping at Oxford,\
  \ Derby, Leicester, Peak Cavern and Northampton and back to London. The book was\
  \ written as a series of letters to Moritz's friend at home and is in two equal\
  \ parts, the first in London, the second walking about.\nThe first edition was published\
  \ in Germany in 1783 with a second improved edition in 1785. In 1795 an English\
  \ translation of the second edition was published as Travels, chiefly on Foot, through\
  \ several parts of England in 1782, described in Letters to a Friend. It contained\
  \ many errors and was attributed to the daughter of Charles Godfrey Woide (1725–1790),\
  \ who himself is described in Chapter 5 \"Information and entertainment\". Despite\
  \ its flaws, it became the standard translation of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\
  \ A new translation was published in 1965 by Reginald Nettel and is now the standard\
  \ English edition.\nIn deciding to complete his journey on foot, Moritz was met\
  \ with a rude reception. The Inclosure Acts had forced Englands peasants to become\
  \ employees of land-owners, and those who could not find employment became the \"\
  wandering poor\" – thus anyone seen walking along the road was identified as a beggar\
  \ or a thief. For this reason, Moritz experienced considerable problems finding\
  \ room and board, and was even run out of some villages, simply for arriving into\
  \ town on foot.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
